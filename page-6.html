                <p>India's exports contracted by 22%, the steepest decline in the last three years, to $32.97 billion in June on account of global demand slowdown, especially in the Western markets like the US and Europe.</p>
                <p>According to the data of the commerce ministry, the trade deficit in June stood at $20.3 billion against $22.07 billion in the same month last year due to a fall in exports and imports.</p>
            <p>The inbound shipments during the month under review declined by a steep 17.48% to $53.10 billion.
                Exports in May 2020 contracted by 36.47% when the world was reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
                Commenting on the numbers, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said trade sector growth is in the hands of global factors.
                <p>As the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has projected a slowdown in world trade, "that fear is coming true", he added.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Citing reasons for the dip in trade growth, he said there is a slowdown in major economies, including the US and Europe; and inflationary pressure.</p><br>
                <p>He also attributed the slowdown to the tightening of monetary policies by the rich nations as it is affecting manufacturing and businesses.</p><br>
                <p>Export promotion councils are expecting the demand to pick up in the coming months. "From July, there should be pick up," the secretary said.</p><br>
                <p>Cumulatively, exports dipped by 15.13 per cent to $ 102.68 billion during April-June this fiscal. Imports too declined by 12.67 per cent to $ 160.28 billion.</p> <br>
                <p>The trade deficit during April-June 2023 improved by 7.9 pc to $ 57.6 billion from $ 62.6 billion in the same period last year.</p> <br>
                <p>Oil imports in June contracted by 33.8 per cent to $ 12.54 billion, while during the April-June quarter, the shipments slipped 18.52 per cent to $ 43.4 billion.</p><br>
                <p>However, gold imports in June rose 82.38 per cent to about $ 5 billion, while it dipped by 7.54 per cent to $ 9.7 billion in the April-June quarter.</p><br>
                <p>The ministry said that India's trade performance, after witnessing "very high" growth in 2022-23, has shown declining trends compared to the high base of last year in the backdrop of a global slowdown.</p>
